# Terminal Emulator for Android

* Note: This is a forked version of Jackpal's terminal emulator application with all of the permissions defined (Besides BRICK for obvious reasons) USER CAUTION IS HIGHLY ADVISED!!!
* Users running Android 6 and above will be able to fine-tune what permissions the application receives. Versions below however, will grant all of the permissions automatically. Again, tread with caution.

Terminal Emulator for Android is a terminal emulator for communicating with the
built-in Android shell. It emulates a reasonably large subset of Digital
Equipment Corporation VT-100 terminal codes, so that programs like "vi", "Emacs"
and "NetHack" will display properly.

This code is based on the "Term" application which is included in the Android
Open Source Project. (Which Jackpal also wrote. :-) )
