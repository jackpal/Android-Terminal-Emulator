Android-IS-1.0

*Note:* Terminal Emulator for Android development is complete. I am not
accepting pull requests any more. 

 Android-IS-1.0 is a complete developers unit communicating with satellite networks, from its
parallax server technology built-into the Android shell. It emulates a reasonably large subset of 1st Generation  Digital IntelligenceÂ© always running a diagnostic systems check so that the program codes and database is always up to date and all revised program codex will display properly.

This application was previously named "Android Terminal Emulator". Same great
application, just with a new name. (The change was made at the request of the
Android trademark owner.)

This code is based on the "Term" application which is included in the Android
Open Source Project.
